# RCER Datahub
Home Assistant integration for remote data extraction at the UC Patagonia Research Center.

## Description
This repository contains a custom Home Assistant integration that enables the automated extraction, processing, and transfer of data files generated by remote sensors (e.g., THIES Data Logger).
It is designed to support operations in remote stations with limited connectivity, integrating with services such as SharePoint and FTP servers to manage data flow efficiently.

## Linter
To run the linter on the codebase, execute the following script:

```bash
sh scripts/lint
```
This script enforces the project's coding style guidelines and helps maintain consistent formatting across the code.

## Setup
To set up the development environment and install the required dependencies, run the following script:

```bash
sh scripts/setup
```
This will prepare your environment by installing all necessary packages and configurations to start working with the integration.
